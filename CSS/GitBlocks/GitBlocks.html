                    <p>
                        Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series
                        of snapshots (commits) of your code base.  With the creation of 
                        each snapshot you build out a whole application, seeing the growth
                        of a full app.  During this time you can make branches to experiment
                        and come back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those 
                        experiments into the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.  It
                        lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those
                        code snapshots that you took during development.
